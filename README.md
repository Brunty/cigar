# Cigar

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Brunty/cigar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Brunty/cigar)

A smoke testing tool inspired by [symm/vape](https://github.com/symm/vape)

This is not ready for real use yet, I'm just playing around...

The code is awful.

## Installation

Install via composer:

`composer require brunty/cigar --dev`

## To use

Create a `.cigar.json` file that contains an array of json objects specifying the `url`, `status` and (optional) `content` to check.

```
[
  {
    "url": "http://httpbin.org/status/418",
    "status": 418,
    "content": "teapot"
  },
  {
    "url": "http://httpbin.org/status/200",
    "status": 200
  },
  {
    "url": "http://httpbin.org/status/304",
    "status": 304
  },
  {
    "url": "http://httpbin.org/status/500",
    "status": 500
  }
]
```

Then run `bin/cigar` to have it check each of the URLs return the status code expected.

```
> bin/cigar                                           
✓ http://httpbin.org/status/418 [418:418] 
✓ http://httpbin.org/status/200 [200:200] 
✓ http://httpbin.org/status/304 [304:304] 
✓ http://httpbin.org/status/500 [500:500] 
```

The format of the lines in the output is:

```
pass/fail url [expected_code:actual_code] "optional text"
```

If all tests pass, the return code `$?` will be `0` - if any of them don't return the expected status code, the return code will be `1`

If you wish to suppress the output of the test run, pass the `--quiet` option to the command: `bin/cigar --quiet`
